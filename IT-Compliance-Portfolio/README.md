\# IT Compliance \& Security Portfolio



This repository contains \*\*sample compliance and security projects\*\* I created as part of my preparation for an entry-level role in \*\*IT Compliance / Security Compliance / ISO 27001\*\*.



The projects simulate real-world documentation for a small IT services company (fictitious: \*BlueShield IT Services GmbH\*) and demonstrate how I approach compliance, GDPR, ISMS, and cloud security.
